    <h2> Conditions I like to work in? </h2>
    
    
      <ul>
        <li> Organized and structured yet calm environment</li> 
        <li>I like to listen to music whilst I work but I do find hard to concentrate if there‚Äôs a lot of noise and distractions </li>

    <h2> Times/hours I like to work? </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> I find myself more productive in the mornings and late evenings, however I prefer to have a ‚Äúround-up‚Äù in the morning so I can organize my day effectively, also if there¬¥s issues and/or things that need to be done I can sort them out during the day and fit them into my schedule. 
        </li> 
      </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="card">
    <h2> The best way to communicate with me? </h2>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Through messages (for example, slack/ telegram or other form of messaging systems) I rarely pick up my phone but I look at text messages
          I also check my e-mail quite often during the day </li>
          <li>Verbally, I like people to communicate in a calm, adequate manner in a two way system, where there‚Äôs active listening and then discussion of ideas. 
          </li> 
        </ul>

      <h2> The way I like to receive feedback?</h2>
      
        <ul>
          <li>I‚Äôd rather be told directly something even if it¬¥s not so good feedback than things being unspoken, so just be direct and straightforward with me! üòä </li>
          <li>I see all of the feedback as a learning/improvement opportunity, so I like to have some examples on how I can improve and/or do something differently </li>
