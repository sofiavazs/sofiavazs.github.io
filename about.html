<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="sofia.jpeg" alt="picture of Sofia">

<p>Originally from Porto (Portugal), Sofia finished her Nursing degree in 2008 and has worked in Healthcare for 12 years, in 2009 she moved to London where she lived for 7 years.</p>
<p>Her experience include working in the Operating room as a Scrub and Anaesthetic Nurse and she is a Clinical Nurse Specialist in Neonatal Intensive Care graduated from St. George's, University of London in 2014. 
<p>In 2015 she visited Stockholm (Sweden) and completely fell in love with the city, so she decided to start learning Swedish and moved permanently to Stockholm in 2016 where she still lives. She works as a Nurse in the overnight intensive recovery room and she's also a pain management nurse. </p>
<p> Since young age, Sofia always had interest in computers mainly influenced by her father and she used to spend her afternoons playing pac-man or prehistorik 2 (after homework of course!), that passion has stayed for years and because she loves to learn new stuff she decided to just take the challenge and become a front end developer. </p>
<p> On her free time she enjoys "annoying" her masjesty "Poppy" a dark grey, green eyed rescue cat, travelling, cooking and ultimately she's an avid VR games player.</p>
